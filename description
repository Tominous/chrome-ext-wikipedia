It supplements Wikipedia.org's existing web interface with some convenient behaviors I always wanted myself. 

Implemented features:
* turns section titles into in-page links for easier bookmarking and sharing particular sections
* enlarge images by 2X when hover
* adjusted enlarged image placement for right-to-left language pages

Future features:
* short excerpt when hover for intra-Wikipedia entry links
* adjustable image zoom level
* turn on/off each features in options page
