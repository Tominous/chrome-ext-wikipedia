Wikipedia Plus supplements Wikipedia.org's existing web interface with some convenient behaviors I always wanted myself. 

Unlike other extensions which aggressively modifies or interferes with the Wikipedia website look and feel, this extension respects the original Wikipedia design. I believe that the most empowering tools are invisible. 

Implemented features:
* show short text snippets for Wikipedia's internal entries when hover
* turn section titles into in-page links for easier bookmarking and sharing particular sections
* enlarge images by 2X when hover
  * adjusted enlarged image placement for right-to-left language pages

Future features:
* adjustable image zoom level
* turn on/off each features in options page
